# AI-Based-Timetable-Generation-System
This project focuses on developing a software-based AI-assisted timetable generation system aligned with NEP 2020. It aims to automate the creation of conflict-free academic timetables for multidisciplinary and credit-based programs such as FYUP, B.Ed., M.Ed. by using constraint-based scheduling logic.
# Objective
